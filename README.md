# Quantitative-Portfolio-Management-Strategy
University of Waterloo Computer Science and Finance Program Final Assignment

In Tickers.xls, random stocks are given in the competition (released to us after the contest to prevent us from picking specific stocks in advance), and the TA will pick 12 stocks after running our program to track for a week to figure out our Average Return Rate.

This code builds a stock portfolio using advanced algorithms and financial analysis. It combines Monte Carlo Simulations, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to evaluate stocks based on volatility, expected returns, and risk factors. The selected stocks are equally weighted, diversifying risk and optimizing returns. The code retrieves market data, identifies optimal stocks through simulations and risk-return evaluations, and calculates the number of shares to buy based on currency conversion and trading costs. Finally, it generates a CSV file detailing the selected stocks and shares for implementation in a simulated portfolio.

We will keep implementing the algorithm in the future!
